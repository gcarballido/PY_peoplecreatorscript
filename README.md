# PY_peoplecreatorscript
Script for Blender that creates people with differents hairs and dresses.

Open "proyecto.blend" with Blender and open the script file peoplecreator.py

The differents hairs and dresses have to be in the same folder than the main project (in this case proyecto.blend). Otherwise change the path.
